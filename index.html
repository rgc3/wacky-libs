      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>
          “The Adventures of Brawny and Keen
     
          Some stories must be told, even if you are afraid to tell them. I suppose few people will ever read these words, and fewer still may believe. Whether they believe or not, I know what I write is true, and that is what matters.<br /><br />
          It seems so very long ago. Time has faded my memory into what now feels like a dream. A dream from another life, perhaps. Well, now I must write what I should have written many years before.<br /><br />
          You see, I believe in magic. I’ve seen it. Things that I can’t explain, yet they are as real as you and me.<br />
          Have you ever not been able to explain something? Think of something you think you know. Now keep asking ‘why?’ and you will see what I mean. We don’t actually know most of the things that we think we do.<br /><br />
          Once you’ve seen magic for yourself, you’ll know what I know; that life without magic is empty.<br /><br />   
          “Peter...Hello, earth to Peter. Why did you stop? Come on. Go to the next page already.”
          Peter’s gaze was fixed on a distant thought. “What do you think it is?”
          Noah huffed[…]”

        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
          <p>
            Peter and Noah hefted the old chest together through the dark, narrow hallway, their shoulders scraping the walls as they went. They stopped at the end in front of a closed door. Peter gave a quick knock and pushed the door in.<br /><br />

            Grandpa Mac sat propped in his bed reading a book. He peered over his spectacles as the boys shuffled in.<br /><br />

            “Hey, Grandpa,” Peter panted, “we found this old chest full of papers up in the attic. It looks like it was written a long time ago. Do you know what it is? Is it real?”<br /><br />

            “Of course it’s real. You’re holding it aren’t you.”<br /><br />

            “That’s not what I mean. I mean, is it true?”<br /><br />
          </p>

        <p>
          “Ah...well now. That’s a question everyone must answer for themselves. I could tell you ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but none of what I say can make any difference. What matters is what you think, because you’re the one who has to decide how you live your life.”<br /><br />

          Noah raised an eyebrow. “I am so confused right now.”<br /><br />

          “What I mean,” Grandpa chuckled, “is that these pages were written to inspire a better life, a life away from brain-rotting television screens and out among a world of real adventure. What matters about these pages is what they whisper to your heart, and if you let that message change you.”<br /><br />

          “So, it is real?”<br /><br />

          “What do you say we find out together? Noah, will you push that old chest over to this old man so that he can reach, please?”<br /><br />

          Noah slid the chest over the rough pine planks to the bedside. Grandpa Mac reached his frail hand inside and thumbed a small bundle from the top of the stack.<br /><br />

          Grandpa Mac cleared his throat and started to read.<br /><br />

          Some stories must be told, even if you are afraid to tell them...<br /><br />

          “Wait, Grandpa. We already read that part. We’re on the next page,” Noah interrupted.<br /><br />

          Grandpa placed the first page aside and started again.
